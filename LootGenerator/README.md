# Loot Generator

## Background

- Procedural content generation in the context of video games is the process of generating content such as levels, art, or other assets “on the fly” rather than up-front. 

- For example, instead of designing a series of levels for a game, we may instead provide several level primitives and then write a series of rules as to how these primitives can be combined to form actual levels. 

- Then we can write a series of procedures or methods that automatically combine primitives according to the rules to form complete levels.

- Many video games have used procedural content generation to great effect. One of those games is the venerable Diablo series of which Diablo III released in 2012 is the latest iteration. 

- Diablo is a Hack and Slash role-playing game that focuses on leveling up and getting loot for your character by killing monsters. 

- The appeal of Diablo is that both the levels and loot are procedurally generated so that the replay value is huge. 

- Many games have emulated Diablo procedural design, in particular, the action role-playing game Torchlight and the first-person shooter/role-playing mash-up Borderlands.

## Description

- The algorithm behind this programs uses mapping data strictire mapped with recursion in a novel way.
