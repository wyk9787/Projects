# Huffman Encoding

## Description

- This program is designed to encode and decode files in the .grin format, a simple compressed file format. The core of a .grin file is an encoding of the file using Huffman’s algorithm. 

- This program is implemented by priority queue.

## Background

A Huffman Code is a scheme for lossless compression of data. Invented by David Huffman while he was a student at MIT, Huffman codes are a relatively simple and open compression technique used in a variety of commonly-used programs and file formats, e.g., various “zip” programs—gzip, pkzip, and bzip2—and image formats like jpegs and pngs.
