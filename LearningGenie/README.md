## Background

- Twenty Questions is a parlor game where one person thinks of an arbitrary thing—traditionally an “animal, vegetable, or mineral”—and another person tries to guess this thing by asking the first person a series of twenty yes-or-no questions. 

- The second person must choose their questions carefully in order to rapidly hone in on the first person’s object of interest.

## Description

- This is a program that plays this questions game with the user and learns from its mistakes, building a database of questions and guesses along the way. 
- The program is persistent in that it remembers its database between subsequent runs of the program. 
- This way, we can train the program to recognize more and more objects over time.
