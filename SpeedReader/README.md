#### Analysis:

These results are ultimately inconclusive. In each test the participants seemed to be making logical deductions about the answers to some of the questions - eliminating answers based on how sensible they were (for example, Sherlock Holmes is clearly not a wizard). The approach our participants took was similar to that of a student taking the ACT or SAT: informed guess-work. In a few instances we observed what seemed to be genuine comprehension of the texts, though in these instances the texts were either quite simple (Alice in Wonderland), or the participant stated that they were already familiar with the text. For example, Ayyad claimed that he "loves" Siddharta. Were we to do this study again, we would probably use a mixture of fiction and non-fiction to reduce the effectiveness of informed guess-work.
